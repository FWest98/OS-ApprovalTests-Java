## toArray

ArrayUtils has the ability to dynamically determine the type of your list.

snippet: toArray 

This works in almost all cases with the notable exceptions of empty arrays, some common interfaces 
which will not be preferenced.
In which case you can always use the overloaded method 
snippet: toArrayWithClass
