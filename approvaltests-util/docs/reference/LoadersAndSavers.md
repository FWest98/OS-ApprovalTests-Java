## What it is

Loaders and Savers is a very simple abstraction to help separate business logic from a database / services layer.

Loaders tend to work similarly in functionality to a stored procedure.

Savers allow you to save changes 

### ExecutableCommand

`ExecutableCommand`s extend Loaders to allow for easy testing.

## Loaders

The Loader interface looks like:
<!-- snippet: loader_interface -->
<a id='snippet-loader_interface'></a>
```java
public T load();
```

<!-- endSnippet -->

The purpose for this is to allow you to split your method into two methods:

1. Small method that gathers the loaders and calls the business logic
1. Larger method that contains your business logic and calls the loaders
