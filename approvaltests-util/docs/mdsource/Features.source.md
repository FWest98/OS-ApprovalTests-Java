## Functions 

Function0 - Function9 are simple interfaces for use with lambdas where you take 0-9 parameters and return a result.
The first 3 have native java equivalents (that I can never remember). If you prefer to use those, but can't remember their name, They are listed in the javadocs.
   Function0 -> java.util.function.Supplier  
   Function1 -> java.util.function.Function  
   Function2 -> java.util.function.BiFunction
   
## Actions 

Action0 - Action9 are simple interfaces for use with lambdas where you take 0-9 parameters and all results are via side-effect (void return).
The first 3 have native java equivalents (that I can never remember). If you prefer to use those, but can't remember their name, They are listed in the javadocs.
   Action0 -> java.lang.Runnable  
   Action1 -> java.util.function.Consumer  
   Action2 -> java.util.function.BiConsumer 
   

## Actions.doNothing()

Action0 - Action9 all have an implementation of the null object pattern for your convenience. 


## SimpleLogger.logToNothing()

SimpleLogger is used to make approvaltesting easier, but approvalTests also uses it internally. Something these bleed out in the form of messages like

snippet: /approvaltests-util/src/test/java/com/spun/util/logger/tests/SimpleLoggerTest.test.approved.txt

if you want to turn them all off just run

snippet: log_nothing

## NullLogger

Null Object Pattern for java.lang.Appendable

## ArrayUtils.addToArray()

Sometimes you wish you could add to an array the same way you can add to a list.
snippet: add_to_array

will result in a new copy of the array with the added items
snippet: add_to_array_result
