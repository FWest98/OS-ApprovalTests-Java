## Joining Collections

Sometimes you have a list that needs to become a string.
For example
snippet: join_collection
will produce
snippet: /approvaltests-util-tests/src/test/java/com/spun/util/StringUtilsTest.testJoinCollection.approved.txt
by invoking the .toString() on each object in the collection.

## Joining Collections with a function
if .toString() isn't enough, you can pass in a lambda to do the extra transformation as well.
For example:
snippet: join_collection_with_lambda
will Produce
snippet: /approvaltests-util-tests/src/test/java/com/spun/util/StringUtilsTest.testJoinCollectionWithFunction.approved.txt
