* remove all checked exceptions
* remove all warnings
* make intellij aware of if it is running and only launch then
* handle manual install of intellij
* write docs on how to make a custom reporter


I'd like to look into using approval tests with junit5's @ParameterizedTest and junit5 in general
https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Java/issues/51
https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Java/issues/36
-> might require introduction of junit5 to the project though (which is good but also some extra work)

* 404 for Website link in readme
* 404 for Getting Started Doc link in readme
* add gradle file to starter project?
* delete SpunConstants ?
* delete Fedex ?
* update readme, how to get it, update to latest version and also add line for gradle
* update readme, examples, show wih junit5 instead of 3?
* publish release also on github: https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository
* update tests to use junit5 engine (which can continue executing junit 4 tests but also junit 5)

* junit5 tests create both files (empty approved file) while junit4 only creates recieved file on first run
* !!! ClipboardReporter does not work with Junit5 !!!

* newer dependency version available:
