## The problem
When you are running tests on multiple machines and CI systems distributed around the globe
the system's time zone can become an issue with having a consistent result.

## The solution
ApprovalTests has a convenience class, `WithTimeZone` to set a consistent time zone for a block of code
Here is an example:

<!-- snippet: with_time_zone -->
<a id='snippet-with_time_zone'></a>
```java
try (WithTimeZone tz = new WithTimeZone("UTC"))
{
  // All code within this block will see the computer as being in the UTC time zone
}
// The computer's time zone will revert to previous setting here
```
