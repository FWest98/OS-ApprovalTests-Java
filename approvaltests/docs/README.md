## Main concepts for ApprovalTests  

[Reporters](Reporters.md#top) Namers & Writers are the 3 pieces that allow ApprovalTests to work. 
 
**Writers** write to a file  
**Namers** figure out what the file should be called and where it is located  
**Reporters** are called on failure to help you determine what went wrong.
