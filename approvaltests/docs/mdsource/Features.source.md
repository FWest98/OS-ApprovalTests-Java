## Test Commit Revert

This is a convenience class to follow the practice 'Test Commit/Revert' from Kent Beck. Simply adding
snippet: test_commit_revert
to you test class will invoke 1 of 2 options

### On success
A dialog will appear asking for a commit message. Once given it will commit all files with that message
![prompt](images/commit_dialog.png)

### On failure
It will revert all changes

Note: this currently only works with git
